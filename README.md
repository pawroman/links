## Algorithms

Articles:

- [Dijkstra's in Disguise](https://blog.evjang.com/2018/08/dijkstras.html)

Books:

- [Algorithms by Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/)
- [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/)

## Code Quality and Good Practices

The Clean trilogy from Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob"):

- [Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code)
- [The Clean Coder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder)
- [Clean Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture)

Programming overall:

- [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html)
- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) - An absolute classic of a book.
  - [Take-home reference](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-pragmatic-quick-reference/) - Sums up the book.

Other:

- [API Evolution the Right Way](https://emptysqua.re/blog/api-evolution-the-right-way/)
- [How To Write Unmaintainable Code](https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code) - Learn what not to do :)

## Command Line Tools

- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - Syntax and git-aware `cat` clone, with automated paging.
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) - Better than `ls`. Also has a `tree`-like switch (`-T`).
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - Better than `find`.
- [htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/) - Excellent process viewer.
- [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) - cURL for humans. Uses Python + requests.
- [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) - CLI benchmarking tool.
- [Midnight Commander (mc)](https://midnight-commander.org/) - The best file manager.
- [mosh](https://mosh.org/) - like `ssh`, but with local echo and roaming. Good for poor connections.
- [mtr](https://github.com/traviscross/mtr) - Better than `ping`.
- [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) - Disk usage analyzer.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - Fast file content searcher.
- [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) - Speedtest from a command line.
- [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) - Correct the previous command.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - A terminal multiplexer, more user-friendly than screen.
- [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) - Execute a command when a path is modified.

### GUI tools

I'm not a big fan of GUI, but there are a few good ones I use:

- [QDirStat](https://github.com/shundhammer/qdirstat) - Analyze disk usage by directory / file type.

## Fonts

Programming fonts I found the most eye-pleasing and readable.

- [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) - My font of choice. Very easy on the eyes, and very unambiguous.

## git

- [Git in a Nutshell](http://www.aosabook.org/en/git.html) - Overview of how git is implemented.
- [Oh shit, git!](http://ohshitgit.com/) - How to revert common git mess-ups.

## Management / dealing with people

- [How to Deal with Difficult People on Software Projects](https://people.neilon.software/) - We all know that "one guy"...
- [How to be a manager](https://getweeklyupdate.com/manager-guide)
- [Unlearning toxic behaviors in a code review culture](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/unlearning-toxic-behaviors-in-a-code-review-culture-b7c295452a3c)
