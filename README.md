## Prelude

Some of my favourite quotes:

> *"Craftsmanship over Crap"* \
> -- Uncle Bob

> *"â€¦ with proper design, the features come cheaply.
> This approach is arduous, but continues to succeed."* \
> -- Dennis Ritchie

> *"Theory is when you know everything but nothing works. \
> Practice is when everything works but no one knows why. \
> In our lab, theory and practice are combined: nothing works and no one knows why."*
